# Midterm-CS20-2023

Hi guys, I created a template HTML and a template CSS under assets.
Feel free to change or modify this template. In the end, we should have
every page follows the template so we can have a consistent look and feel
across the website

Please create a new folder under pages when you add your page into the
project (maybe not the main page?)

All the art/content resources should be placed in their folders
under assets so that everybody can access them
